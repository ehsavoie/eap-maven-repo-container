# Build a container image that provides an EAP Maven repository

## Prerequisites

* You have access to an OCP cluster 
* `oc` and `docker` executable are available
* You are logged in the OCP cluster

## Instructions

First, you need to download a zipped archive of EAP with the command

[source,bash]
----
wget -c --no-check-certificate <url to jboss-eap-8.0.0.Beta maven-repository.zip> 
----

Then, you run the script `deploy.sh` with the name of the zip archive that has been downloaded

[source,bash]
----
./deploy.sh <jboss-eap-8.0.0.Beta maven-repository.zip>
----

The script will build the container image that contains the EAP Maven repository and exposes it with a simple HTTP server.
The image is pushed to the OCP Container registry and a deployment is created from it.

Once the script is availabled, the Maven repository is available inside the cluster with a HTTP URL similar to 
`http://eap-maven-repo.<OCP namespace>.svc.cluster.local:8080`.
